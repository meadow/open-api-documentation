description: 'How to handle responses from Meadow endpoints'
---

The Meadow API is completely JSON based. All of our response's are wrapped in a `data` envelope like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "key": "value"
  }
}
```

For endpoints that return multiple items, they will be formatted like this:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "key": "value"
    },
    {
      "key": "value"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>You may notice there are extra properties in a response than are documented on the respective endpoint. Generally speaking, you should only ever have to use the properties that we explicitly document. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.</Note>
