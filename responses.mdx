description: 'How to handle responses from Meadow endpoints'
---

The Meadow API is completely JSON based. All of our response's are wrapped in a `data` envelope like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "key": "value"
  }
}
```

For endpoints that return multiple items, they will be formatted like this:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "key": "value"
    },
    {
      "key": "value"
    }
  ]
}
```
