description: 'How to handle errors returned from Meadow endpoints'
---

Meadow uses  HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a order could not be created, etc.). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Meadow's servers (which should happen very infrequently).

# Error Response

When an error is returned, it will be in the following format

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  A human readable string to describe the error to a developer
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="code" type="string">
  A code pertaining to a specific Meadow error (Example: `INVALID_API_CREDENTIALS`)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="meta" type="object">
  Some errors will contain additional information in this object to help debug the issue
</ResponseField>

### Example

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Your API credentials are invalid.",
    "code": "INVALID_API_CREDENTIALS"
  }
}
```

# Error Codes

Below is a list of error codes that Meadow may return on various requests. This list does not contain every single error that is possible, so we encourage you to handle unknown codes that you have not seen before.

### `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS`
The `X-Client-Key` is valid but does not have the proper permissions for that endpoint
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "This API client key does not have permissions to perform this request.",
    "code": "INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS"
  }
}
```

### `INVALID_API_CREDENTIALS`
Thrown when either the `X-Consumer-Key` or `X-Client-Key` provided is invalid
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Your API credentials are invalid.",
    "code": "INVALID_API_CREDENTIALS"
  }
}
```

### `INVALID_CHILD_RESOURCE`
Thrown when data submitted is not owned by the parent resource specified (Example: Submitting options that belong to another product)
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "That child resource does not belong to the specified parent.",
    "code": "INVALID_CHILD_RESOURCE"
  }
}
```

### `INVALID_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY`
The`idempotencyKey` submitted is not a valid uuid v4. We recommend using the `idempotencyKey` returned from pricing so you do not run into this error.
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "idempotencyKey must be a uuid v4",
    "code": "INVALID_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY"
  }
}
```

### `INVALID_INVENTORY_TYPE`
A product option ID was or was not passed when it was supposed to. Check the `inventoryType` of the product. If it is `option` then `productOptionId` should be passed, otherwise do not include this ID in the purchase order line item.
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Incorrect inventory type submitted.",
    "code": "INVALID_INVENTORY_TYPE"
  }
}
```

### `INVALID_PARAMS`

  }
}
```

### `INVALID_ORDER`

    "message": "The organization does not support that order type.",
    "code": "INVALID_ORDER_TYPE"
  }
}
