# Inventory Type

Products in Meadow can track their inventory in 1 of 2 ways that will be determined via their `inventoryType` property.

### `option` tracking

For these types of products, inventory and costs (`movingAverageCostPerUnit`) is attached to the product options as opposed to the product itself. With this case, the `option.amount` property is disregarded as everything is tracked by units. So the `quantity` of a line item in an order is exactly how much inventory will be subtracted from that product option.

### `product` tracking

Products have inventory and costs (`movingAverageCostPerUnit`) set at the product level as opposed to the product option level. An example of this would be flower product where there is a raw amount of inventory (I.E. 750 grams). When a product option is purchased, the amount of inventory used is `option.amount` * `quantity`. For example, if you bought 2 eighths of a product option with amount 3.5, it would subtract 7 from the inventory.

### `none`

When `inventoryType` is set to `none`, it means that this product does not track inventory.
