## Step 1 - Retrieve payment types

Fetch all the payment types for an organization using [GET /api/v1/payment-types](/endpoints/orders/list-payment-types)

## Step 2 - Create a payment with the order

When retrieving pricing ([POST /api/v1/orders/pricing](/endpoints/orders/retrieve-pricing)) and creating an order ([POST /api/v1/orders](/endpoints/orders/create-order)), you will need to create a payment to be associated with that order using a Stronghold payment type. To do this, please submit a `payments[]` array alongside the rest of your request body like so:

```javascript
{
  "lineItems": [
    {
      "productOptionId": ####,
      "quantity": #
    }
  ],
  ...REST_OF_ORDER_PROPERTIES,
  "payments": [
    {
      "paymentTypeId": ####,
      "remaining": true
    }
  ]
}
```

The value used for `paymentTypeId` needs to come from one of the payment methods fetched in Step 1. Please submit `"remaining": true` along with it to signal this payment is for the remaining amount of the order.

## Step 3 - Create the Stronghold payment intent

Create a Stronghold payment intent using [POST /api/v1/payment-intents](/endpoints/orders/create-payment-intent). You must retrieve the `orderPaymentId` to submit using the response from creating an order. You will find this ID in `data.payments[0].id`.

## Step 4 - Show customer the Stronghold link

After you create the payment intent, you will receive a `strongholdLink` as part of the response. This is a webpage where the customer can complete their payment. You may either redirect the customer to this page, or show them a button that when clicked will take them to this page.

The rest of the Stronghold payment flow will be able to be completed in the Meadow backend.
