There are two queues used in the waiting rooms:

**Intake Queue**

The intake queue is used to track which customers are currently waiting at intake, the front desk, or a waiting room, generally prior to being admitted to the shop floor where the POS stations are located. It also shows the intake station if the customer has a pending order, for example a pickup, in case there are special instructions for such customers.

**POS Queue**

The POS queue is used to track which customers are currently waiting in the shop floor where the POS stations are located. Any user with a POS station can view and select customers from the queue to start a new order or (following a prompt) process any existing order, for example a pickup.
