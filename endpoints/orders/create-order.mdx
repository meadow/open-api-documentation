# Idempotency

In order to prevent accidental double orders from being placed from issues such as network failures, Meadow uses an `idempotencyKey` strategy. For every request to create an order, the request body must include an `idempotencyKey` which is a unique [UUID v4 string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)).

If an order for this key has already been placed, it will be returned as the data instead of placing a duplicate order.

In order to simplify this process for integrators, an `idempotencyKey` is returned from the [pricing request (POST /api/v1/orders/pricing)](/endpoints/orders/retrieve-pricing). Please save the key from the last pricing request you use and submit it along with the order.

Please reach out if you have any questions about this.
