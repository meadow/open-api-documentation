## Identify the customer

Include at least one of the following fields in the request body so Meadow can locate the customer that should receive the loyalty points:

- `customerId`
- `customerEmail`
- `customerPhone`

If the customer could not be found then the API will return a 404 response with an `error.code` of `USER_NOT_FOUND`.
