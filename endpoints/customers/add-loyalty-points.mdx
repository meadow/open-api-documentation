## Loyalty

Use the `POST /api/v1/loyalty-events` endpoint to add loyalty points to a customer account.

### Identify the customer

Include at least one of the following fields in the request body so Meadow can locate the customer that should receive the loyalty points:

- `customerId`
- `customerEmail`
- `customerPhone`

If the customer could not be found then the API will return a 404 response with an `error.code` of `PATIENT_NOT_FOUND`.

### Request fields

- `pointsAmount` (number, required) — the amount of loyalty points to add to the customer's balance.
- `reason` (string, required) — a note describing why the points are being awarded.

The API response returns the newly created loyalty event with auditing information, including who awarded the points and when the event was created.
