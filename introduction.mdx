description: 'Get started using the Meadow API'
---

The Meadow API is written using common “RESTful” idioms found in many well-used APIs. All of our responses are formatted in JSON, and endpoints that accept data require the data to be sent in JSON format.

## Environments

For production, all requests should be made using `https://api.getmeadow.com`

When testing, please use our staging sandbox `https://api-staging.getmeadow.com`

## Content Types

The Meadow API always accepts JSON in request bodies and returns JSON in response bodies. You will need to send the `content-type: application/json` header in requests.
